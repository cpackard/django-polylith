# Polylith Django Demo

Project demoing the [Polylith architecture](https://polylith.gitbook.io/polylith/) using the Django [app system](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/ref/applications/).

## Setup

### Installing Poetry

This project uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) as the package manager. To install the tool on your local machine, run the command

```shell
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
```

### Running a local project

After installing Poetry and downloading the repo, install the dependencies for the project and run the migrations. Then you're set to run the development server:

```shell
poetry install
poetry shell
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver
```

You can run any command in this doc as an ad-hoc command in your root shell by prefixing it with `poetry run`. The rest of this doc assumes you're in an active `poetry shell` for brevity.

## Structure and Organization

Since this is a Django variant of the Polylith architecture it uses most of the key terms from the [Polylith overview docs](https://polylith.gitbook.io/polylith/introduction/polylith-in-a-nutshell).

To summarize the table below: *libraries* are used by *components*, which represent app entities through an `interface` module. *Bases* expose functionality of *components* publicly through endpoints. *Projects* assemble each of these into an artifact like a service.

Below are the Django-specific details of each term.

<details><summary>Component</summary>
<p>

Each component lives in a separate directory in the `components` folder and contains a `src/<component>` and `tests` directory.

The `interface.py` module is a set of functions using native data structures (e.g. lists and maps) for inputs and outputs. Each function in the `interface` module "passes-through" to an equivalent function in `core.py`, which enables encapsulation and allows for any private implementation (like using the ORM).

- This constraint is necessary both as a “protocol” between components and to ensure encapsulation. For example: if the `questions` module returned `Question` ORM objects, that would expose the implementation details of using the ORM, and allow callers to use methods on the object for functionality instead of those from `questions.interface`.

`apps.py` is the module for [Django app configuration](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/ref/applications/#configuring-applications) and `models.py` is the standard module for data models. The `pyproject.toml` file is for specifying any libraries needed by the component.

```
▾ workspace
  ▾ components
    ▾ questions
      ▾ src
        ▾ questions
          ▸ migrations
          __init__.py
          apps.py
          core.py
          interface.py
          models.py
      ▸ tests
      pyproject.toml
```

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Base</summary>
<p>

Like components, each base lives in a separate directory in the `bases` folder and contains a `src/<base>` and `tests` directory, and they also include the `apps.py` configuration module.

Bases expose component interfaces through endpoint functions defined in the conventional Django `views.py` module, which have their routes defined in `urls.py`.

```
▾ workspace
  ▾ bases
    ▾ api
      ▾ src
        ▾ api
          __init__.py
          apps.py
          urls.py
          views.py
      ▸ tests
      pyproject.toml
```

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Project</summary>
<p>

A project is the result of combining one base (or in rare cases several bases) with multiple components and libraries.

Unlike bases and components, projects have no `src` or `tests` directories because they contain no logic of their own. Instead, they hold the common top-level Django configuration modules like `settings.py` and `wsgi.py`. They combine the urls from any bases used into their own `urls.py`.

A project's `pyproject.toml` includes the components and bases as dependencies for the final artifact.

```
▾ workspace
  ▾ projects
    ▾ api
      ▾ api_project
        __init__.py
        apps.py
        settings.py
        urls.py
        wsgi.py
      pyproject.toml
```

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Development Project</summary>
<p>

The development project is where we specify all the components, bases and libraries that we want to work with. Like other projects, they have a `settings.py` and `urls.py` modules, but these are used to work with components and bases across *any* project for local development. These dependencies are specified in the top-level `pyproject.toml` file. Additionally, it includes a `scripts.py` module to define helper commands available from a `poetry shell`.

```
▾ workspace
  ▾ development
    __init__.py
    scripts.py
    settings.py
    urls.py
  pyproject.toml
```

</p>
</details>

## Development

### Adding a new component

You can create a new component using the project's command:

```shell
create-component <new_component_name>
```

You can also get help for any command by passing the `--help` flag:

```shell
create-component --help
```

### Create migrations

Migrations can be created for any components by running the `makemigrations` command for it from the root of the repo:

```shell
python manage.py makemigrations questions
```

Then apply the migrations as normal:

```shell
python manage.py migrate
```

#### Defining foreign-key relationships between components

From the [Django docs](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/ref/models/fields/#foreignkey):

> To refer to models defined in another application, you can explicitly specify a model with the full application label. For example, if the `Manufacturer` model above is defined in another application called `production`, you’d need to use:

```python
class Car(models.Model):
    manufacturer = models.ForeignKey(
        'production.Manufacturer',
        on_delete=models.CASCADE,
    )
```

### Running Tests

To run tests for the entire project, run this command from the root of the repo:

```shell
pytest -v
```

By default, this command will use the `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE = "development.settings"` attribute in the root-level `pyproject.toml`. You can override this by setting a `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` environment variable or by passing the `--ds` CLI flag like `pytest --ds=api_project.settings`. See the [pytest-django docs](https://pytest-django.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuring_django.html#) for more info.
